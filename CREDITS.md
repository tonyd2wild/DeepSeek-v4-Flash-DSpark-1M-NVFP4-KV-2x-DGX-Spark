# Credits

This repo combines several public efforts. Please credit the upstream authors
when reusing the recipe, the patch, or benchmark numbers.

## DSpark Concurrency Patch

The in-server DSpark concurrency breakthrough comes from Keys / drowzeys:

- Repo: https://github.com/drowzeys/Keys-Concurrency-Patch-for-DSpark-DeepSeek-V4-Flash
- Tested commit in this repo: `7e4d94bbcec95223550517c0fa9244e59f9f6483`

Keys' patch fixes the two core blockers for `max_num_seqs > 1`:

- Request-stable DSpark main-KV slots, so persistent DSpark draft KV follows
  request identity instead of condensed vLLM batch-row position.
- Ragged `query_start_loc` handling for real independent-arrival batches where
  prefill and decode rows mix in the same scheduler step.

The validated concurrency numbers in this repo depend directly on that patch.

## DSpark vLLM Integration

Rafael Caricio published the DSpark vLLM integration and deployment work this
recipe builds on:

- https://github.com/rafaelcaricio/vllm/pull/1
- https://github.com/rafaelcaricio/spark_vllm_docker/pull/1

## Model And Runtime Work

Fraser Price published the DeepSeek V4 Flash DSpark model/runtime work used by
this recipe:

- https://huggingface.co/fraserprice/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark
- https://github.com/fraserprice/dspark-vllm

## Two-Node DGX Spark Packaging

MiaAI-Lab published the two-node DGX Spark packaging and launch lineage this
repo builds from:

- https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/DeepSeek-v4-Flash-DSpark-2x-DGX-Spark

## Upstream Foundations

This work also relies on:

- vLLM
- FlashInfer
- NVIDIA CUDA/NCCL/Blackwell tooling
- DeepSeek V4 Flash
- DeepSeek-AI DeepSpec / DSpark speculative decoding research

## TonyD2Wild Contribution

This repo contributes the validated 2x DGX Spark NVFP4-KV recipe, Stage A/B/C
runtime packaging, sanitized two-node launch flow, application of Keys'
concurrency patch to the NVFP4 profile, and benchmark artifacts from the
validated runs.
